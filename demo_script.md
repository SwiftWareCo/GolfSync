# GolfSync Demo Script & Strategy

**Goal**: Demonstrate superiority over "igolf" by highlighting Speed, Real-time Sync, Modern UI, and New Features (Events/Charges).
**Setup**: Runs on Laptop. Ideally, use two browser windows side-by-side or a split view to show the "Admin" vs "Display" sync.

## 0. Pre-Demo Checklist

- [ ] **Clean State**: Ensure today's teesheet has some open slots but also some bookings (to show it's alive).
- [ ] **Tabs Open**:
  1. **Tab A (Admin)**: `/admin/teesheet` (or your main dashboard).
  2. **Tab B (Proshop Display)**: `/admin/proshop/display` (This represents the TV in the proshop).
- [ ] **Login**: Ensure you are logged in as a Super Admin to see all tabs.

## Phase 1: The "Instant" difference (Speed & UX)

_Objective: Contrast with "Long load times" and "Unintuitive" legacy apps._

1.  **Start at the Dashboard/Home**.
    - **Say**: "I know one of your biggest frustrations is waiting for the system to catch up. GolfSync is built on modern tech—it doesn't load pages; it flows between them."
2.  **Navigate Fast**:
    - Click between **Tee Sheet**, **Members**, and **Events** rapidly.
    - **Say**: "Notice there's no white flash, no loading bars. It's instant."
3.  **Visuals**:
    - Point out the color coding or clean layout.
    - **Say**: "We stripped away the clutter. You see exactly what you need: Green for Checked-in, Grey for Empty."

## Phase 2: The "Sync" Problem (Real-time Display)

_Objective: Solve "Polling is only on admin, not display"._

1.  **Setup**: Bring **Tab A (Admin)** and **Tab B (Display)** onto the screen visible at the same time.
2.  **The Action**:
    - **Say**: "You mentioned your current display screen gets stale. Watch the screen on the right."
    - In **Tab A (Admin)**: Book a popular time slot (e.g., 9:00 AM) for a Member (e.g., "John Doe").
    - _Wait approx 15s (or keep talking)_: The **Tab B (Display)** will automatically populate with "John Doe".
3.  **The Climax**:
    - **Say**: "That happened potential hands-free. No refreshing the TV. Your starters and marshals always see the live truth."

## Phase 3: Operational Efficiency (Lottery & Fairness)

_Objective: Show "Complicated" features simply._

1.  **Navigate to `Lottery` / `Admin > Lottery`**.
    - **Say**: "Managing high-demand times is stressful. We built fairness directly into the core."
2.  **Show the Dashboard**:
    - Briefly show the "Requests" vs "Allocated" view.
    - **Say**: "We handle the math. If 50 people want 8:00 AM, the system fairly allocates it based on your rules, tracking who got it last week so nobody abuses the system."
    - _(Skip technical details of the algorithm unless asked)._

---

## Phase 4: Missing Features (Events & Charges)

_Objective: "It doesn't have events and charges like ours."_

1.  **Navigate to `Events`**.
    - **Click** on an upcoming event (e.g., "Men's Open").
    - **Show**: The Registration list and the "Add Payout" or "Details" view.
    - **Say**: "Instead of a paper binder or a separate system, your events live right on the sheet. Returns, payouts, and scoring can be handled here."
2.  **Navigate to `Charges/Finance`** (if accessible easily) or **Member Profile**.
    - Show a Member's "Account" or "History".
    - **Say**: "And we track the financials too. Cart fees, guest fees—charged directly to the member's account."

## Phase 5: Conclusion

1.  **Navigate back to the main Teesheet**.
2.  **Summarize**:
    - "It's fast."
    - "It keeps everyone in sync automatically."
    - "It handles the complex stuff (Lottery, Events) so you don't have to."
3.  **Ask**: "Would you like to see how we handle a specific scenario, like a Frost Delay or a Shotgun start?"
    - _(Have the `Frost Delay` modal mental-ready just in case, since you were working on it recently!)_
